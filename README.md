# Database "Scientific journal"

The scientific journal accepts author's articles. Each article has at least one author, three abstracts (English, Ukrainian, Spanish), keywords, language of writing, and a file with the full text stored on the server. 

For each article, the journal's editorial board appoints two reviewers who assign scores (from 1 to 5) based on the criteria of novelty, relevance, completeness of the literature review, completeness of the presentation of the material, quality of the text, and write a report with their own impression for the editorial board and remarks for the authors. 

The administration automatically receives reviewers' scores and reports, and authors automatically receive reviewers' scores and comments (anonymously).
